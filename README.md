# Prework Study Guide Wbpage for Bootcamp

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to collect basic information in preparation for a bootcamp on web development. I wanted to create a guide that would help myself and other students have a repository of information to refer to as we embark on the experience. With this basic information all located in one place, it creates an easy reference for HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. I learned an incredible amount of skills and information in the process of creating it: everything from navigating the command line to adding details with CSS, to making the page interactive with JavaScript.

## Usage

In the study guide you will find basic information fro HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. There are two ways to use it to study. You can study the information as it is presented, or randomly slect a section to study. If you would like to use the latter feature, open the Chrome Dev Tools by pressing Control+shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (MacOS). This will bring up a control panel window that will offer a suggestion for which topic to study first, along with the list of topics in the study guide.
