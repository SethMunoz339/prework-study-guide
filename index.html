              <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
              <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
              <li>elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
              <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet, which allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS files must be linked to the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Class attributes enable sharing a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The period preceding designates a class selector.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git is a way to write code outside of the website and add it to the website later.
          </li>
          <li>To do this you create a branch to add and edit code.</li>
          <li>Then you commit changes and push your work to your repository or "repo".</li>
          <li>Then you create a pull request so your work can be reviewed and approved.</li>
          <li>Once it is approved, you can merge your work with the main branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code that the browser ignores.</li>
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
          <li>Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response (like a mouse click).</li>
          <li>Using inspect examining the console is a good way to debug code.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
